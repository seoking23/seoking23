- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Douglas Seo. @seoking23 on github!
- I don't have much on here just yet, but I didn't get around to using github until recently!
- I have plenty of scripts on my harddrive backed by iCloud.
- TODO for 2023: put them on github!
-  But that is such a pain if you didn't start building with source control in the first place!
-  
-  Anyways,
-  I am excited to build legacy out here!
